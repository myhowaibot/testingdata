To add the X-Served-By header in Apache, you can use the mod_headers module. You can add the following line to your Apache configuration file:

```
Header set X-Served-By "%{SERVER_NAME}s"
```

This will set the X-Served-By header to the server name. You can also use other variables like `%{SERVER_ADDR}` or `%{REMOTE_ADDR}` to set the header to the server or client IP address respectively.

To add the X-Served-By header in Nginx, you can use the add_header directive. You can add the following line to your Nginx configuration file:

```
add_header X-Served-By $hostname;
```

This will set the X-Served-By header to the hostname of the server.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

You can put the configuration line in the Apache or Nginx configuration file. The location of the configuration file depends on your operating system and the web server installation.

For example, on Ubuntu, the Apache configuration file is located at `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` and the Nginx configuration file is located at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`.

You can add the configuration line to the end of the file or in a specific section of the file depending on your needs.

You can use the curl command to check if the X-Served-By header is being set correctly. You can run the following command:

curl -I http://example.com
Copy
Replace http://example.com with your website URL. This will show you the HTTP headers returned by the server. Look for the X-Served-By header in the output.

Alternatively, you can use your web browser’s developer tools to inspect the HTTP headers returned by the server.
